The ST Sales Dashboard is an interactive and fully dynamic data visualization project built in Microsoft Power BI.
The main goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales performance, enabling management and decision-makers to track revenue, profit, and quantity trends across different states, customers, and product categories.
This project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can transform raw data into actionable insights through clear visuals, data storytelling, and interactivity.

Objectives

To monitor the overall sales performance of the company.

To identify top-performing states, customers, and product categories.

To analyze profitability trends over time.

To provide interactive features that allow users to filter and explore the data easily.

To visualize payment mode distribution and understand customer purchasing behavior.



Dashboard Features & Visuals
1. Sum of Amount by State

A horizontal bar chart compares sales across multiple states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi — making it easy to identify regions with the highest revenue.

2. Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode

A donut chart visualizes the proportion of sales made through different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Cash, Online Payment).
This helps understand which modes of payment customers prefer.

3. Profit by Order Date

A line chart shows daily profit trends, highlighting fluctuations in earnings over the selected time period.
It helps identify profitable and low-performing days.

4. Sum of Amount by Customer Name

A bar chart showcasing top customers (Harivansh, Madhav, Madan Mohan, Shiva) based on the total purchase amount — helping identify loyal and high-value customers.

5. Sum of Quantity by Category

A donut chart displays category-wise product sales distribution, identifying which category contributes the most to total sales (e.g., 63% from top category).

6. Sum of Profit by Sub-Category

A horizontal bar chart representing profit contribution from various sub-categories such as Printers, Bookcases, Sarees, Accessories, and Tables.

7. Filters and Slicers

State Filter: Allows users to view data for specific states or all combined.

Order ID Filter: Helps in tracking and analyzing specific orders (B-25601, B-25602, B-25603).
